    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Calzone is a folded Italian pizza that's stuffed with a variety of
      delicious ingredients. The dough is made from flour, yeast, water, and
      salt, and it's kneaded until it's smooth and elastic. The dough is then
      rolled out into a circle, and the filling is placed in the center. The
      dough is then folded over the filling, and the edges are sealed. The
      calzone is then baked until the crust is golden brown and the filling is
      hot and bubbly. The calzone is then sliced into wedges, and it's served
      with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast over the
        top, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until foamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture, then mix in the
        flour until dough starts to come together. Tip dough out onto a surface
        floured with the remaining all-purpose flour, and knead until all of the
        flour has been absorbed, and the ball of dough becomes smooth, about 10
        minutes. Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface.
        Cover loosely with a towel, and let stand in a warm place until doubled
        in size, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the dough is doubled, tip the dough out onto a lightly floured
        surface, and divide into 2 pieces for 2 thin crust, or leave whole to
        make one thick crust. Form into a tight ball. Let rise for about 45
        minutes, until doubled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll a ball of dough with a rolling pin until it will not stretch any
        further. Then, drape it over both of your fists, and gently pull the
        edges outward, while rotating the crust. When the circle has reached the
        desired size, place on a well oiled pizza pan. Top pizza with your
        favorite toppings, such as sauce, cheese, meats, or vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 16 to 20 minutes (depending on thickness) in the preheated
        oven, until the crust is crisp and golden at the edges, and cheese is
        melted on the top.
      </li>
    </ol>
